<h3> by AntonioSantos </h3>

<p>You are my rainbow </p>
<p>
    Your Beliefs
    Your attitude
    Your thoughts
    Your perspective
    How honest you are
    Who your friends are
    What books you read
    How often you exercise
    The type of food you eat
    How many risks you take
    How you interpret the situation
    How kind you are to others
    How kind you are to yourself
    How often you say “I love you.”
    How often you say “thank you.”
    How you express your feelings
    Whether or not you ask for help
    How often you practice gratitude
    How many times you smile today
    The amount of effort you put forth
    How you spend / invest your money
    How much time you spend worrying
    How often you think about your past
    Whether or not you judge other people
    Whether or not you try again after a setback
    How much you <strong>appreciate the things you have</strong>
